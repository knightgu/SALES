## Description

This R package implements the elastic net and (adaptive) lasso penalized sparse
asymmetric least squares (SALES) and coupled sparse asymmetric least squares
(COSALES) using coordinate descent and proximal gradient algorithms. It offers a
way of analyzing heterogeneity in high-dimensional data.
