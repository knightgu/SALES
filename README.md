R Package for High-Dimensional Asymmetric Least Squares
================

-   [Description](#description)

## Description

This R package implements the elastic net and (adaptive) lasso penalized
sparse asymmetric least squares (SALES) and coupled sparse asymmetric
least squares (COSALES) using coordinate descent and proximal gradient
algorithms. It offers a way of analyzing heterogeneity in
high-dimensional data.
